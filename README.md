## ISE435, F2020: Final Project

## Overview
Allows for user to analyze personal financial data from excel files. The data is separated into three columns, Date/Category/Expense.

a) The date provides when the transaction was made. It is given in the MM/DD/YYYY format.

b) The category is a one-word description of the transaction (e.g. if the expense was for eating at a restaurant, it would be labeled as 'Food').

c) The expense gives the amount spent for the transaction. It is given in the $#,###.## format.
