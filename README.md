ISE435, F2020: Final Project
================================
Overview:
================================ 
Allows user to analyze personal financial data from excel files. The data within the file is separated into three columns, Date/Category/Expense.  
    a) The date is the date that a transaction occurred. It is given in the MM/DD/YYYY format. 
    b) The category is a one-word description of the transaction (e.g. a transaction made for eating at a restaurant would be labeled as 'Food')
    c) The expense is the amount paid during the transaction. These sheets only include expenses, not any money made/received.
